You have all of your deja-dup tar volume stored somewhere and the software refuse to restore files? If nothing else work, this is probably your last resource. As explained here https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/DejaDup/Help/Restore/WorstCase#Restoring_by_Hand
sometimes the only way is to manually cat the various pieces into the original file. This simple bash script make this operation recursively. 

BEWARE! THIS SOFTWARE IS ON TESTING PHASE! IF YOU WANT TO USE IT, OPEN THE SCRIPT AND READ INSIDE, YOU WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO CHANGE LINE OF CODE ACCORDINGLY TO YOUR NEEDS!
